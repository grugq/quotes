18. Don’t harass the opposition.<br />
19. Make sure they can anticipate your destination.<br />
20. Pick the time and place for action.<br />
21. Any operation can be aborted; if it feels wrong, then it is wrong.<br />
22. Keep your options open.<br />
23. If your gut says to act, overwhelm their senses.<br />
24. Use misdirection, illusion and deception.<br />

26. Float like a butterfly; sting like bee.<br />

<p>30. Once is an accident; twice is a coincidence; three times is an enemy action.<br />
31. Avoid static lookouts; stay away from chokepoints where they can reacquire you.<br />
32. Select a meeting site so you can overlook the scene.<br />
33. Keep any asset separated from you by time and distance until it is time.<br />
34. If the asset has surveillance, then the operation has gone bad.<br />
35. Only approach the site when you are sure it is clean.<br />
36. After the meeting or act is done, “close the loop” at a logical cover destination.<br />
37. Be aware of surveillance’s time tolerance so they aren’t forced to raise an alert.<br />
38. If an alert is issued, they must pay a price and so must you.<br />
39. Let them believe they lost you; act innocent.<br />
40. There is no limit to a human being’s ability to rationalize the truth.</p>
