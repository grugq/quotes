Only break one law at a time.

ProTip: you’re not worth an 0day.

Fear of 0day is like being terrified of ninjas instead of cardiovascular disease.

I’m not going to advise you on how to break the law other than to suggest that you shouldn’t.

Cyber is really only effective as an offensive capability. Defence has mitigation, detection, resilience, etc...but at the end of the day, cyber is a domain that favours the offensive (of course, once on someone else's network, you're on the defensive) 

%

make compromises: cost more; yield less; harder to use; easier to find. Analyze them, & stay awake

%

Fetishising 0day means that people think once a vulnerability is public there's some sort of automagic immunity.
%

It's surprising how critical good phishing technique is with these APT attacks. Effective phishing is more important than 0day.

I think I understand the US strategy against Chinese APT. It’s to flood the APT with so much data they won’t have analysts to review it all.

"Only break one law at a time."

"Never lie by accident."

Conducting influence campaigns isn’t that hard. It doesn’t require state-spectrum investment or capabilities. All you need is a plan, an audience, time, and an achievable goal. Keep good records, never lie by accident, iterate fast, use themes for guidance.
Yes. Accidental lies can totally blow your operation. Only lie when you know what and why. It must be purposeful
More of a “one law at a time” thing. You want to be in control of your messaging. Lies can confuses things or completely sink the ship.
A) A riot in Boston D.C. killed 7
B) A riot in DC killed 7

It’s clear to the target audience “A” fishy, but “B” is not self evidently wrong
Similarly to one lie at a time is one operation at a time. If your hijacking TV to inject fake data don’t also try to add satirical commentary to the news caster. The two ops would get jumbled and risk exposing each other. Everything must be deliberate

%

Laws make criminals. Repeal more laws, you get fewer criminals, they can use the law courts to settle contractual disputes rather than violence.

%

snowden argues the same techy bullshit argument other geeks have: that tech can defeat law, so ignore policy
it's complete bullshit. It makes geeks feel powerful while not actually doing anything useful.

They violate the primary rule of maintaining security against a nation state - don’t break the law.

Yeah, I’m just being stupid about bureaucracy and organizations these days. Wondering if there’s units that work to enable the dev teams (hack for certs, hack for source, hack for infrastructure) and so on. Just like an army isn’t all infantry, what elements make up an APT group?

cyber pathogen profilaxis is a common complication from APT infections.

%

The phrase for today is: collection bias. We see only the ops that get caught in the sector that is being monitored. The view port on APT activity is limited and skewed. Our data sets suck.

Wonder how much the style of attacks has to do with provenance. That is, pen testers mimic old school hackers, APT is repeatable success.

TBF, there’s not much a civilian group can do to protect against an APT.

Does anyone except Russian crooks & pen testers still do “Step 1: hack the server“ style pen tests? The world has standardized on APT right?




This is like the APT starter pack: Flash, win33k, old Java *and* old office, everything a gov contracting house runs on every workstation!

%

If I’m understanding this correctly, “cyber” is something you catch from a Chinese if you have unprotected APT?

%

in peace, prepare for apt

%

WTF is wrong with people? The opposition will use the cheapest most reliable tool every time they can. Yes, the GRU uses phishing (and 0day)

%

Russia can afford to kill the opposition’s 0day, regardless of how good, because they don’t care much about stealth or preserving exploits.

%

APTs use what works. But it’s kinda embarrassing if you don’t make them at least burn 0day... 

%

Fetishising 0day leads to bizarre situations where ppl think that making more vulnerabilities known to more people reduces risk.

%

Yes. 0day are for hardened HVT. Like spices, you don’t want to over use them, just enough

%

I’ll concede it isn’t perfect or feasible in every case, but I think “decruitment” is a totally viable offensive technique in a variety of situations. It is a variant of “countering violent extremism” in a way. Provide an off ramp, throw in incentives (if possible)

%

actually not a stupid question.



Any competent offensive cyber team is going to need to detect whether they’ve popped a compromised box. They need a simple operational tool that works and doesn’t leak intelligence about what they know regarding other teams’ tooling —because it is run on a compromised host. 

%

Reminder to everyone: [bug bounties use] market forces to secure things by raising the cost of offensive ops, not the cost of defence.

Phrack, uniformed, etc are the alchemical grimoires of cyber security. Practitioners scribbling down what they knew from experiments and presenting the knowledge to their peers. They’re presented authoritatively, rich w/ arcane detail, on the path to professional discipline
As an industry we still don’t know how to produce “hacker enlightenment” other than walking the old paths. Some of the Services have developed private colleges for professionalized training, but even they aren’t reliable at creating “master” hackers.
Hacking is beyond the “alchemy” phase, but it’s not yet “chemistry.” Is it just gonna take more time? What would we need to bridge that gap?

Ransomware is not about encrypting data. It is the _current_ implementation of a methodology that coerces the victim to act as an agent for the criminal (typically to acquire BTC.) Encrypting data just an implementation detail; it’s the “coerced agent” part that matters. There are infinite ways to coerce someone once you have access to their data. People will pay more to keep their secrets from their friends than to regain access to their data.

In none of the targeted attacks me and @CDA observed against Iranian civil society we found a 0day used. Mostly no "exploit" at all in fact. Besides the usual .scr, we see a variety of Office tricks, and embedding of PowerShell in a variety of file formats (e.g. LNK) as well as repackaging of legitimate software. [...] Surely, there's a lot of human mistakes involved, but as long as we enable e.g. executing embedded EXEs through PowerPoint animations the human mistakes seem more tolerable, and development and employment of exploits way less "profitable". Most of the tricks I observe used for infection also have the "advantage" of requiring way less situational awareness from the attacker which significantly reduces costs and improve success rate for attackers [...] In some sadistic way, I wish we'd be in a place where exploits were really required, at least it would sensibly increase costs for attacks.
