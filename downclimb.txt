You can get 25% off a Mandiant incident response with the code: ITWASCHINA. 100% off if you just use that code as the report.

Ransomware is not about encrypting data. It is the _current_ implementation of a methodology that coerces the victim to act as an agent for the criminal (typically to acquire BTC.) Encrypting data just an implementation detail; it’s the “coerced agent” part that matters. There are infinite ways to coerce someone once you have access to their data. People will pay more to keep their secrets from their friends than to regain access to their data.

An important lesson to learn is not to deploy tools before they are ready. The risk is revealing capability before you can exploit it

That’s pretty amazing discipline from the attackers. They discard 5 9's of infections to focus on a tiny subset. No chance that’s criminals

Are there any #pwn2own winners that aren’t sponsored by massive Chinese Internet companies? It’s the equivalent of a Google team winning. No doubt the teams are skilled, but this is just marketing for the Chinese audience. 'Tencent wins hacking competition!' 'Baidu wins...' Is it time to accept that #Pwn2Own has outlived its usefulness to the community? Companies paying each other for marketing... *yawn*

In none of the targeted attacks me and @CDA observed against Iranian civil society we found a 0day used. Mostly no "exploit" at all in fact. Besides the usual .scr, we see a variety of Office tricks, and embedding of PowerShell in a variety of file formats (e.g. LNK) as well as repackaging of legitimate software. [...] Surely, there's a lot of human mistakes involved, but as long as we enable e.g. executing embedded EXEs through PowerPoint animations the human mistakes seem more tolerable, and development and employment of exploits way less "profitable". Most of the tricks I observe used for infection also have the "advantage" of requiring way less situational awareness from the attacker which significantly reduces costs and improve success rate for attackers [...] In some sadistic way, I wish we'd be in a place where exploits were really required, at least it would sensibly increase costs for attacks.
