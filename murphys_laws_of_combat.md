						<li>A sucking chest wound is Nature's way of telling you to slow down.</li>
						<li>If it's stupid but it works, it isn't stupid.</li>

						<li>Never forget that your weapon was made by the lowest bidder.</li> 
						<li>If your attack is going really well, it's an ambush.</li>
						<li>The enemy diversion you're ignoring is their main attack.</li>

						<li>The important things are always simple; the simple are always hard.</li>
						<li>The easy way is always mined.</li>
						<li>Teamwork is essential; it gives the enemy other people to shoot at.</li>
						<li>Don't look conspicuous; it draws fire. For this reason, it is not at all uncommon for aircraft carriers to be known as bomb magnets.</li>
						<li>Never draw fire; it irritates everyone around you.</li>

						<li>There is always a way, and it usually doesn't work.</li>
						<li>Success occurs when no one is looking, failure occurs when the General is watching.</li>
						<li>The enemy never monitors your radio frequency until you broadcast on an unsecured channel.</li>

						<li>As soon as you are served hot chow in the field, it rains.</li>

						<li>The most dangerous thing in the combat zone is an officer with a map.</li>

						<li>If you really need an officer in a hurry, take a nap.</li>
						<li>The only time suppressive fire works is when it is used on abandoned positions.</li>
						<li>There is nothing more satisfying that having someone take a shot at you, and miss.</li>
						<li>Don't be conspicuous. In the combat zone, it draws fire. Out of the combat zone, it draws sergeants.</li>
						<li>If see you, so can the enemy.</li>
						<li>All or any of the above combined.</li>
						<li>Avoid loud noises, there are few silent killers in a combat zone.</li>
						<li>Never screw over a buddy; you'll never know when he could save your life.</li>
						<li>Never expect any rations; the only rations that will be on time and won't be short is the ration ofshit.</li>
						<li>Respect all religions in a combat zone, take no chances on where you may go if killed.</li>

					<h4>Laws of War for Helicopters</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Helicopter tail rotors are naturally drawn toward trees, stumps, rocks, etc.<br />
						While it may be possible to ward off this event some of the time, it cannot, despite the best efforts of the crew, always be prevented.<br />
						It's just what they do.</li>
						<li>The engine RPM and the rotor RPM must BOTH be kept in the GREEN.<br />
						Failure to heed this commandment can adversely affect the morale of the crew.</li>
						<li>The terms Protective Armor and Helicopter are mutually exclusive.</li>
						<li>"Chicken Plates" are not something you order in a restaurant.</li>
						<li>The BSR (Bang Stare Red) Law:<br />
						The louder the sudden bang in the helicopter, the quicker your eyes will be drawn to the gauges.<br />
						Corollary: The longer you stare at the gauges the less time it takes them to move from green to red.</li>
						<li>Loud, sudden noises in a helicopter WILL get your undivided attention.</li>
						<li>The further you fly into the mountains, the louder the strange engine noises become.</li>
						<li>It is a bad thing to run out of airspeed, altitude and ideas all at the same time.</li>
						<li>"Pucker Factor" is the formal name of the equation that states the more hairy the situation is, the more of the seat cushion will be sucked up your butt.<br />
						It can be expressed in its mathematical formula of:<br />
						 S (suction) + H (height above ground) + I (interest in staying alive) + T (# of tracers coming your way).<br />
						Thus the term 'SHIT!' can also be used to denote a situation where a high Pucker Factor is being encountered.</li>
						<li>Running out of pedal, fore or aft cyclic, or collective are all bad ideas.<br />
						Any combination of these can be deadly.<br />

						<li>Helicopters have been described as nothing more than 50,000 parts flying in close formation. It is the mechanics responsibility to keep that formation as tight as possible.</li>
						<li>It is mathematically impossible for either hummingbirds, or helicopters to fly. Fortunately, neither are aware of this.<br />

						<li>Tanks draw fire. A lot of it. It does not behoove the infantryman to hide behind one.</li>
						<li>If you're close enough to actually hear an M1 series tank running, while in combat, and not part of the crew, you're too close.<br />

						<li>Afterburners aren't.</li>
						<li>Air Brakes don't.</li>
						<li>Your cannon will jam in combat, and then when you get back to base there will be nothing wrong with it.</li>
						<li>You may have the better plane, but the enemy is the better pilot. (or vise versa)</li>
						<li>When getting spare parts for your aircraft, you can get them CHEAP - FAST - IN GOOD CONDITION,<br />
